## Challenge 1 - Let's Create A "Toggle" Button

### Challenge Scope

<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f8/b6/5a/f8b65a79475ddaac8e9f4dcf2efa030f.gif"
alt="toggle button icon"
style="float: left; height: 100px; width: 100px; margin-right: 10px;" />

This button should:

- be a single button whose appearance changes on each click (appearance can mean color or w/e)
- have 2 or more states
- should cycle through the states and effectively loop

Fun ideas:

- Have the button disable when it cycles 3 times through the states
- Connect the button to an external image
- Move the button on click
- Add your own behavior!
